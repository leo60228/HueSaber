# HueSaber
Dead-simple Philips Hue integration for Beat Saber.

## Usage
Press the blue button on your hub then hit the Sync Hue button under Mods. Make sure you have an entertainment group added in the Philips Hue app.

## Effects
The first entertainment group available will track the background color of the game, at 70% brightness. It will dim for 0.1 seconds whenever you make a bad cut or miss, and illuminate fully for 0.1 seconds whenever you make a good cut.
